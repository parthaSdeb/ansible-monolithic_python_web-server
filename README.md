Monolithic python web server installation and configuration
==============================================================

In this project we created a python Application using flask framework and as a database we used mariadb.

Requirements
------------
- Python2
- pip package installer
- mariadb

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - python_enviornment
         - mariadb
         - web_flask
